  <h1>About CowLog</h1>
  <HR/>

  <p>
CowLog is a software for recording behaviors from digital video developed in the Research Center for Animal Welfare and Department of Agricultural Sciences in the University of Helsinki. We created CowLog, because we wanted a free easy to use program for coding digital video. CowLog is open source software and it is therefore free to use and modify.
  </p>

<p> The program supports behavioral coding from multiple videos and
    unlimited number of freely defined behavioral codes and classess. You can
    also choose to use modifiers for behaviors.
</p>

<p>Define a new project from "Project setting" menu option to
   define the behaviors and basic info about your project and after
   that click "New subject" button to start coding. I also
   recommend you read the short help before you start.
