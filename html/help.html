    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        This is the help of this online version of Cowlog
        behavioral coding software. It should work with Firefox
        and Chrome. However you need to start Chrome with the
        "--allow-file-access-from-files" command line
        option. You will also need to allow pop-up windows for
        this site so that you can save the data.
    </p>

    <p>
        The program runs almost entirely in client side (in your
        webbrowser). Server is only accessed to format the
        results click the <span class="button">Save
	  results</span> button and <span class="button">Save
	  settings</span> button. No data is saved on the
        server. If you wan't to avoid server calls entirely you
        can use the <span class="button">Open results</span>
        and <span class="button">Open settings</span> buttons
        instead and save the data from opened browser
        windows. You can also save the webpage to your computer
        and use it offline (make sure you save the complete
        page).
    </p>


    <h3>Setting up the project</h3>

    <p>
        You can use choose between 2 video players:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            HTML5 native video tag. You can set different
            playback rates for this player only in
            Chrome. Supports <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_video.asp">limited
        </a> video formats, but it doesn't need any plugins.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.videolan.org/"
               target="_blank">VLC</a> player plugin which supports
            a lot more video formats, but requires you to
            install VLC plugin.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>
        You can set the project properties from the "Project settings"-menu. You
        can choose the video player, the number of behavioral
        classes and behaviors and set the names of the
        classes and set keyboard shortcuts for coding. </p>

    <p>You can also choose to use modifiers, in which case the
        video will pause when a behavior with modifiers is
        selected. Modifier names are give as a comma separated
        list to a text input box, they can be from any main
        behavioral class.</p>



    <p>
        You don't need to name the buttons if you just
        want to use the numbers as your codes.
    </p>

    <h3>Coding and saving</h3>


    <p>Click the <span class="button">New subject</span> button to
        open a video from your harddrive and set subject name and the
        date and time the video was filmed (these are not required,
        but can be helpfull), set the subject properties and start
        coding using the buttons. If you are using VLC player you need
        to set the video directory manually.</p>

    <p>After you have finished click
        the <span class="button">Save results</span>
        or <span class="button">Save results</span> button and a
        download or new window with the transciption should
        appear. If it doesn't make sure you have disabled the
        pop-up blocker</p>

    <strong>The result format depends on the selected configuration.</strong>

    <p>
        If there are no modifiers the result format has three columns:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Time. Seconds from beginning.</li>
        <li>Code. The behavioral code.</li>
        <li>Class. The class that the code belongs to.</li>
    </ol>


    <p>
        If modifiers are used there are result format will be
        slightly different: The first column will contain the
        time and the following columns contains the behavioral codes
        followed by potential modifiers.
    </p>

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>There is no support for analysing the data from this
        version yet. We have found out that almost every project
        needs some specific work in doing the analysis and its
        quite difficult to come up with good general analysis code
        without significant input. However, I'll try to write some
        analysis code for simple cases in the future.</p>

    <h3>Implementation</h3>

    The code behind this website is written in Javascript and
    HTML uses the new HTML5 markup. HTML5 is an unfinished
    standard and thus the page doesn't work in all
    browsers. If you wan't to learn how to modify this page I
    suggest you start
    from <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/"
            target="_blank">w3schools</a>.



    <h3>Converting videos for suitable codecs:</h3>

    <p>
        You can use the following programs to convert video to HTML5 compatible format:      </p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank">Handbrake</a>
            convert to MP4 for Chrome.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/"
               target="_blank">MiroVideoConverter</a>
            convert to MP4 (Chrome), and Ogg or VP8 for Chrome of Firefox.</li>
        <li><a href="http://v2v.cc/~j/ffmpeg2theora/"
               target="_blank">ffmpeg2theora</a>
            convert to Ogg for Chrome or Firefox.</li>
    </ul>
